# Landing Page Project
Hey there, this is my second project with Udacity FEND, I've tried using new techniques I've learned through my journey here such as "for of loop" and how to manipulate the DOM while keeping the code efficiency and performance.

## Table of Contents

* [Navigation](#Navigation)
* [Section Active State](#ection_Active_State])
* [Scroll to Anchor](#Scroll_to_Anchor)

## Navigation
As per the project rubric, I've built a dynamic navigation bar will change according to sections.

## Section Active State
To determine the active state in sections I've used the Intersection Observer API following my session leader suggestion, which is more efficient and has less code to write.

## Scroll to Anchor
I've used a new CSS feature to get a smooth scrolling
